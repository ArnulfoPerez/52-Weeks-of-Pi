# 52 Weeks of Pi
I read about Shekhar Gulati's "52 technologies in 2016" idea, where he's learning something new and posting it to GitHub every week. You can see what he's up to [here](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016).

Inspired by his goal, I've decided to set my own goal of 52 Pi projects over the next year, since I've been trying to get more familiar with it. That doesn't mean they'll be big or anything... I'm going for consistent learning more than anything else.

1. **Transmit Morse Code Via LED**: A Python script for translating input (via the keyboard) into morse code, and transmitting it via on-off LED blinks (or anything else you connect to a GPIO pin).

2. **Send Morse Code Via Button Click**: A Python script for accepting incoming signals (via a button on the bread board that "closes" the circuit), and translating the input into morse code.

## Issues? Errors?

If you notice a typo or something that's blatantly wrong, I'd appreciate pull requests with fixes. I don't know much about the Pi yet, and the last thing I want to do is steer someone wrong...

Alternatively, feel free to post an issue if you want to bring something in here to my attention. Thanks!
