# Sonic Pi Grandfather Clock
This is my first experience with Sonic Pi, the environment where you can "program" music. I created a small Python script that monitors the current time. On the quarter-hour, it plays a series of notes from the [Westminster Quarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Quarters), a popular melody for clocks.

[I wrote more about the setup here](https://grantwinney.com/creating-music-with-sonic-pi-on-the-raspberry-pi).

## To Run

Run the Chime.py file.

I uploaded a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VXSJ3EMTgk) if you're interested in seeing it work.

## Notes:

* When the red LED is flashing near the end, Sonic Pi is playing a low note (E3) but the camera didn't pick it up.

* OSC stands for OpenSound Control... I called it something else in the video, and knew it didn't sound right when I said it.
