# Candle Simulation Using an RGB LED and PWM

More playing around with an RGB LED and pulse width modulation (PWM).

This time I tried to simulate a flickering candle, which starts bright and yellow, and then dies down to a dim red glow. It can be brightened up again with the click of a button.

## To Run

`python3 CandleSimulation.py`

## Notes

The pins for each color, and for the button, are listed at the top of the script. Change as desired.
